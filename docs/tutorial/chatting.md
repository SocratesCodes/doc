# Chatting with our AI tutor

This guide will cover the chatting feature of SocratesCode.

This guide assumes you have already setup/deployed the application and have a user account. See [here](auth.md) for more details.

## Send message to AI tutor
This can be used regardless of whether you have logged in or not. However, it is recommended to log in to use the full features of SocratesCode.

1. Go to 'Chat' page
2. Type something in the chat page's input field
3. Click on the send button to send your message

AI should display a status indicator and start to process your message and you should see the response from AI after a while.

## Create your own thread
For user who wants to go beyond chatting with our AI temporarily, you can create your own thread. SocratesCode will save your conversation thread and its history and you can come back to it at any time.

It is similar to chatting with our AI tutor, the only difference is that you need to create a thread first before doing so via "New Thread" button located on the top right corner of the sidebar. The thread should be created afterwards, and you should see the thread in the thread list with custom name relevant to your query generated.
