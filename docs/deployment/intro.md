# Introduction to deployment

This guide section will cover the deployment of SocratesCode to your own server with proper tools and configurations.

!!! warning "Note"
    This guide focuses on setting up deployment with AWS as we have only have experience deploying it on this platform. Other cloud providers may work, however keep in mind that we haven't tested it yet and will not provide any support for it.

These details will be discussed at greater detail in the following guides:

## Deployment checklist
- Check if your server meets the [requirements](requirements.md)
- Get your server ready with [necessary software](preparation.md)
- Configure necessary [environment variables](environment.md)
    - It is similar to [development environment variables](development/environment.md) for local development, but with some differences
- Start deployment with [our deployment guide](deployment.md)
- Verify it works with [deployment validation](deployment_validation.md)
